# Xcode Build

This Action builds an Xcode project.

> This Action has mostly been tested on macOS products. Although it probably just works, the goal is to support iOS and watchOS officially with the next release of this Action.

## Basic Usage

For simple projects where there is one scheme, invoking `xcode-archive` can be as simple as this:

```yaml
- name: "Build"
  uses: devbotsxyz/xcode-build@v1
```

Note that if you are building for distribution, you probably want to use the [xcode-archive]() and [xcode-export-archive]() Actions to build and re-sign a macOS product.

## Full Example

The [devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings](https://github.com/devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings) project is an example macOS project with a [release.yml](https://github.com/devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow that shows all the steps needed to go from creating a release in GitHub to ending up with a `.zip` file that contains a signed and notarized application.
